# Browser Extensions Manager UI

This is a solution to the Browser Extensions Manager UI challenge on Frontend Mentor. The challenge is to build a responsive user interface for managing browser extensions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The project consists of a browser extensions manager UI that allows users to toggle, filter, and manage extensions. The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

### Features

- Toggle extensions between active and inactive states.
- Filter extensions by active or inactive status.
- Remove extensions from the list.
- Select a color theme for the UI.
- Responsive design for both mobile and desktop views.
- Interactive hover and focus states for all interactive elements.

### Lesson

Eventhough this project would've been easily created with React, making it in Vanilla JS gave me a first-hand experience of the under-the-hood operations of React such as re-rendering with state change
